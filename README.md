# Heart Disease Predictor

🔍 **Explore the likelihood of heart disease with machine learning!**

This Python project utilizes three powerful algorithms—Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine—to predict the probability of heart disease in individuals. The user-friendly interface, built using Tkinter, provides an intuitive experience for data visualization and model evaluation. Analyze and understand the factors influencing heart health with ease!

🚀 **Key Features:**
- Predict heart disease using three machine learning models.
- Interactive Tkinter GUI for easy visualization.
- Utilizes popular Python libraries like scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Evaluate model performance and make informed decisions.
